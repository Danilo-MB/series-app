# TV Show Search App

Welcome to the TV Show Search App! This React Native application allows you to search for your favorite TV shows using the TVMaze API. You can browse through various TV shows, view their details, and keep track of your favorite shows.

## Features

- Search for TV shows
- View detailed information about TV shows
- Save your favorite shows for quick access

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version v16.14.0)
- Android SDK

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Danilo-MB/series-app`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd series-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app on Android: `npm start` `cd android npm run android`

## General Caveats
1. The application was only tested for android devices
2. The devices used for testing the UI were: 
 - Motorola G20 (physical device)
 - Pixel XL API 30 (Android Studio emulator)
4. The UI was tested with the default screen configuration (default screen and font size). Different configurations may show sone sizing issues IÂ´m planning to address soon.
